In the code blocks, you can specify the language for syntax highlighting by writing the language name after the opening triple backticks. For instance, specifying `bash` will enable appropriate syntax highlighting for shell commands.

Markdown is primarily for formatting and displaying text, so it won't execute or run the code; it's meant for showcasing code and providing instructions.
